To open the project, open the file called urban explorAR.xcworkspace NOT urban explorAR.xcodeproj. This file will not work properly as it is the project without necessary APIs.

The source files are located in the urban explorAR folder and have extension .swift.

There are further source files in the JSON_structures file.

The scripts used for the PHP web services are included in the PHP Scripts file.
